# LinkedIn Automation Bot

This project is a LinkedIn automation tool that helps you log in to LinkedIn, search for people (even 2nd or 3rd degree connections), and scrape their full profile information using Playwright.

The main goal is to collect only the actual profile content (not sidebar recommendations) and export everything into a clean text file.
